    {# 
        This macro modifies the default behavior of the ref macro of dbt. The objective is 
        to create a  means to defer to certain models  that are built in different schemas, 
        for example, production models.

        When you defer a model to one previously built  you don't have to build them in your
        personal schema which saves time, resources and costs.

        The recommended way to use this macro is to choose models that are well mature from a
        development perspective,  in other words, donâ€™t suffer changes too frequently and are 
        time and  resource intensive to  build. Some good candidates  are incremental staging
        models and intermediate models that have many children.
